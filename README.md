# Blockchain-First Smart University

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
- **Blockchain (Weil Chain) = Core Authority (≈99%)**: Governs decisions, stores policies, and enforces rules.
- **Weilliptic SDK**: Defines deterministic, step-based workflows (MCP style).
- **Icarus**: Executes and visualizes the workflows.
- **Agent AI (≈1%)**: Only acts as a trigger to convert human intent into a workflow start.

## 🧩 Technology Roles
- **Weilliptic SDK**: Workflow definition.
- **Icarus**: Execution, branching, and visualization.
- **Weil Chain**: Policies, enforcement, and immutable history.
- **Agent AI**: Thin trigger layer (1% power).

## 🚀 Execution
Run the system using the unified dashboard. Enter commands like:
- "Check attendance and enforce policy"
- "Identify at-risk students and run governance"
